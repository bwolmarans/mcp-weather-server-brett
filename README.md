# Brett's Changes

Really just the agent I created with claude, that I then prompted to create a bash script that would use the custom mcp server.
Also: When I first forked this, it only worked with Claud Desktop and getting that to work on Windows is not something I succeeded doing, so I want to add some instructions here on how to get this to work with Claude code:

```
claude mcp add my-node-server -- node /home/brett/mcp-weather-server/build/index.js
```

Added stdio MCP server my-node-server with command: 
```node /home/brett/mcp-weather-server/build/index.js``` to local config


File modified: /home/brett/.claude.json [project: /home/brett/mcp-weather-server]


( I removed the large YT video thumbnail that used to be here )

Here is some text I copied from my run:

 ▐▛███▜▌   Claude Code v2.0.36

  ▘▘ ▝▝    /home/brett/mcp-weather-server

> which mcp servers do you have access to?

● I have access to one MCP server:

  my-node-server (appears to be your weather MCP server)

  This server provides two tools:
  - get-alerts - Get weather alerts for a US state (takes a 2-letter state code)
  - get-forecast - Get weather forecast for a location (takes latitude and longitude)

  Based on the codebase context, this is the MCP weather server you've built using the National Weather
  Service API. It's currently connected and available for me to use!

  Would you like me to test it out by fetching some weather data?

> using my custom weather mcp server, what is the weather in thousand oaks, ca?

● I'll get the weather forecast for Thousand Oaks, CA using your weather MCP server. Thousand Oaks is
  located at approximately latitude 34.17 and longitude -118.84.

● my-node-server - get-forecast (MCP)(latitude: 34.17, longitude: -118.84)
  ⎿  Forecast for 34.17, -118.84:                                                           

     This Afternoon:
     … +69 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Your custom weather MCP server is working great. Here's the weather forecast for Thousand
  Oaks, CA:

  Current Conditions (This Afternoon):
  - 89°F and Mostly Sunny
  - Wind: 5-15 mph from the NNE

  Upcoming Highlights:
  - Tonight: Dropping to 57°F, partly cloudy
  - Veterans Day (Monday): Nice day at 80°F, mostly sunny
  - Wednesday Night - Thursday: Rain expected with showers likely continuing through Friday
  - Weekend: Clearing up with temps in the mid-60s, mostly sunny

  Looks like there's some rain coming mid-week, but otherwise pleasant weather! Your MCP server
  successfully fetched the forecast from the National Weather Service API.

  ⎿  Agent changes:
     Created agent: bash-menu-chat-builder

> can you generate a bash script using the bash agent we just created that will create a text based bash
 shell script that gets a prompt from the user, passes that prompt to local claude code, and then
returns the reponse from claude code to the user?

● I'll use the bash-menu-chat-builder agent to create an interactive bash script that lets you chat with
   Claude Code from the terminal.

● bash-menu-chat-builder(Create interactive bash chat script)
  ⎿  Done (2 tool uses · 15.7k tokens · 50.9s)                                              

● Perfect! I've created an interactive bash chat script for you at claude-chat.sh. The script provides a clean, user-friendly terminal interface to chat with Claude Code.

  Key features:
  - Continuous chat loop - have multiple conversations without restarting
  - Color-coded interface (your messages in green, Claude's in blue)
  - Special commands: exit/quit to leave, clear to clear screen, help for info
  - Error handling and input validation
  - Graceful exit with Ctrl+C

  To use it:
  ./claude-chat.sh

  The script will continuously prompt you for messages, send them to Claude Code CLI, and display the responses in a nicely formatted way. Type exit when you're done chatting!

  ========================================

Type your message and press Enter to send.
Type exit, quit, or press Ctrl+C to exit.
Type clear to clear the screen.

# MCP Weather Server

A ready-to-use implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that extends Claude with real-time weather data capabilities.



  

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open communication framework that allows AI models like Claude to interact with external tools. This enables Claude to access real-time data, process files, and interact with external services - capabilities not available to most LLMs out of the box.

Learn more about MCP:
- [MCP Official Documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) <!-- Replace with actual link to Claude MCP docs -->
- [Getting Started with MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server) <!-- Replace with actual link to MCP getting started guide -->
- [Postmans MCP Developer Community](https://discord.gg/kTnA7cpn) <!-- Replace with actual link to MCP community -->

## What This Repository Contains

This repository provides:

1. **Complete MCP Weather Server**: A fully functional implementation that gives Claude access to real-time weather data
3. **Template Code**: Use as a starting point for your own MCP projects
4. **Configuration Examples**: Sample configuration files for connecting to Claude Desktop

## Features

The MCP Weather Server implements two primary tools:

- **get-forecast**: Retrieve current weather conditions and forecasts for any location by latitude/longitude
- **get-alerts**: Check for active weather alerts in any US state

Once connected, Claude can:
- Answer questions about current weather conditions
- Provide detailed weather forecasts
- Alert users to severe weather warnings
- Make recommendations based on weather data

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [Claude Desktop](#) <!-- Replace with actual link to Claude Desktop download page -->
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript/JavaScript

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SterlingChin/mcp-weather-server.git
   cd mcp-weather-server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Connecting to Claude Desktop

1. Open your Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%AppData%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the following configuration (update the path to point to your repository):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "weather": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": [
           "/absolute/path/to/your/mcp-weather-server/build/index.js"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Restart Claude Desktop

4. Look for the hammer icon in Claude Desktop, indicating that MCP tools are available

### Testing Your Implementation

Try asking Claude these questions:
- "What's the weather like in San Francisco right now?"
- "Are there any weather alerts in Texas today?"
- "What's the forecast for Chicago this weekend?"

## Building Your Own MCP Server

This repository can serve as a template for building your own MCP servers. Follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository or create a new one based on its structure
2. Replace the weather API implementation with your own service
3. Define your tools by adding new files in the `src/tools` directory
4. Register your tools in `src/index.ts`
5. Build and test your implementation

For detailed guidance, check out our [step-by-step tutorial](docs/TUTORIAL.md).

## API Information

This server uses the [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api), which is free to use and doesn't require authentication. Other APIs you might consider integrating include:

- Dictionary/Language APIs
- News and Information APIs
- Public Data APIs
- Financial APIs

When selecting APIs for your MCP server, consider:
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limits
- Data format and parsing complexity
- Update frequency

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Claude can't find your server**: Verify your configuration path and restart Claude Desktop
- **API requests failing**: Check your internet connection and API endpoint status
- **Unexpected responses**: Look at Claude Desktop logs at `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`
